# Forward Syntax Implementation Todo List

## Immediate TODOs

- [ ] area/ribbon mark
- [ ] sorting needs to preserve mark selection
- [ ] layer needs to allow coordinate transform

## Eventually

- [ ] Fast next-layer for when you are just selecting the previous layer
- [ ] control over scatter pie radii
- [ ] z-indexing
- [ ] position using center?

## Basic Charts

- [x] bar chart
- [x] horizontal bar chart
- [x] scatter plot
- [x] line chart
- [ ] area chart
- [x] pie chart

## Still Basic

- [x] stacked bar chart
- [x] grouped bar chart
- [ ] stacked area chart
- [x] donut chart
- [x] rose chart

## Slightly More Complex

- [x] streamgraph
- [x] mosaic
- [x] waffle
- [x] ribbon
- [x] polar ribbon
- [ ] ridgeline
- [ ] layered area
- [-] scatter pie (needs more control over variable radii)
- [-] connected scatter plot (needs z-index control. also a bug when replacing circle w/ scaffold
  that seems like it's not getting placed in the center but at some other place)
- [ ] flower chart
- [ ] balloon

## Even More Complicated

- [ ] bump chart
- [ ] box and whisker
- [ ] violin plot
- [ ] stringline
- [ ] icicle chart
- [ ] sankey tree
- [ ] nested waffle
- [ ] nested mosaic
