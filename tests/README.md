# Visual Snapshot Testing

DOM snapshot testing for GoFish Graphics, replacing Chromatic with a free, self-hosted system. Captures rendered DOM from every Storybook story, compares against checked-in baselines, and generates an HTML diff report on failure.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install deps (if not done)
pnpm install
npx playwright install chromium

# Capture snapshots and compare against baselines
pnpm test:visual:js

# Accept current output as the new baselines
pnpm test:visual:update
```

## How It Works

### Batch Capture (no Storybook build required)

Instead of building a static Storybook and navigating Playwright to each story URL, the system uses a **Vite dev server** that imports all story modules via `import.meta.glob`. A single Playwright page loads the runner, then renders each story in sequence by calling its `render()` function directly — no page navigation between stories. This makes capture very fast (~76 stories in a few seconds).

### Pipeline

```
stories/**/*.stories.tsx
        │
        ▼
   Vite dev server (stories-runner.ts)
        │
        ▼  Playwright renders each story, extracts innerHTML
        │
   Normalize DOM (round floats, stable IDs, sort attrs)
        │
        ├──► tmp/js/<path>.html   (normalized DOM)
        └──► tmp/js/<path>.png    (screenshot)
                    │
                    ▼
        compare.ts: diff against __snapshots__/dom/
                    │
                ┌───┴───┐
              pass     fail → diff-report.html
```

### DOM Normalization

Both JS and Python DOM go through identical normalization (`scripts/normalize-dom.ts`):

1. **Strip wrapper markup** — remove `initializeContainer()`'s `margin: 20px` div
2. **Round floats** — SVG attributes (`x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, `transform`, `d`) rounded to 4 decimal places
3. **Normalize IDs** — replace generated UUIDs/counters with sequential `__id0__`, `__id1__`, etc.
4. **Sort attributes** — alphabetical order per element
5. **Normalize whitespace** — consistent formatting

## Commands

| Command                       | Description                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm test:visual:js`         | Capture JS snapshots and compare against baselines            |
| `pnpm test:visual:update`     | Capture and accept as new baselines                           |
| `pnpm test:visual`            | Full test: JS capture + Python capture + compare              |
| `pnpm test:visual:check-sync` | Check that changed JS stories have updated Python equivalents |

## Developer Workflows

### Adding a new story

```bash
# 1. Write the JS story
vim packages/gofish-graphics/stories/forwardsyntax/Bar/BarNew.stories.tsx

# 2. Capture and accept baselines
pnpm test:visual:update

# 3. Write the Python equivalent
vim tests/python-stories/forwardsyntax/test_bar_new.py

# 4. Verify everything passes
pnpm test:visual:js

# 5. Commit (story + baselines)
git add .
```

### Intentional change (bug fix, feature)

```bash
# 1. Make the code change
vim packages/gofish-graphics/src/ast/shapes/rect.ts

# 2. Run tests — they fail showing what changed
pnpm test:visual:js
# "1 regression(s) detected. See tests/tmp/diff-report.html"

# 3. Review the HTML diff report (side-by-side before/after screenshots)
open tests/tmp/diff-report.html

# 4. If correct, accept new baselines
pnpm test:visual:update

# 5. Verify
pnpm test:visual:js
```

### Unintentional regression

```bash
# CI fails → download diff report artifact, or run locally:
pnpm test:visual:js
open tests/tmp/diff-report.html
# See before/after screenshots → fix the bug → re-run (should pass against existing baselines)
```

## Python Parity

Every Storybook story should have a Python equivalent in `tests/python-stories/` that produces identical DOM. The Python API calls into the same JS rendering engine via IR, so DOM output should match exactly.

### Python story format

```python
# tests/python-stories/forwardsyntax/test_bar_basic.py
from gofish import chart, spread, rect
from python_stories.data import SEAFOOD

def story_default():
    return (
        chart(SEAFOOD)
        .flow(spread("lake", dir="x"))
        .mark(rect(h="count")),
        {"w": 400, "h": 400, "axes": True},
    )
```

Stories with `derive()` use a Python HTTP server (`scripts/derive-server.py`) that executes the Python functions during rendering, mirroring the AnyWidget RPC architecture.

### Sync enforcement

`pnpm test:visual:check-sync` checks that when a JS story changes in a PR, the corresponding Python story is also updated. Stories listed in `tests/.python-sync-exempt` are excluded.
