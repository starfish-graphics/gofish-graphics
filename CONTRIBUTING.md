# Contributing to GoFish

Thanks for considering contributing to GoFish!

## Your First Contribution
Here are some easy ways to help make the project better without having to understand the codebase first.
- **Open an issue with a chart you want to make** in GoFish but can't/don't know how to. Attach an image of what you want to make and describe what you've tried already.
- **Contribute to our documentation!** https://github.com/starfish-graphics/gofish-docs
- **Contribute to the project's infrastructure.** (Check for the "good first issue" tag for these.)

## Your First Codebase Contribution
If you want to start contributing to the codebase itself, **try the "good first codebase issue" tag.**

## Larger Contributions
**Read our GitHub wiki** to learn more about the project's design philosophy. Major changes to the project (like adding a new intermediate representation or interaction/animation) will require a more back-and-forth conversation in the issues before we come to a consensus on what to do.
