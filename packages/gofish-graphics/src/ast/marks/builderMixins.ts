/**
 * Runtime mixins for `ChartBuilder`.
 *
 * `.facet()` and `.stack()` are sugar for `.flow(spread/stack(...))`. They
 * live here (not on the class itself) so `chartBuilder.ts` doesn't need to
 * import the v3 `spread`/`stack` operators — that import would cycle back
 * through `createOperator` and into `chartBuilder.ts` itself. By patching
 * the prototype from a separate module that imports both pieces, the cycle
 * never closes.
 *
 * This file is loaded for its side effect from `lib.ts`. Importing it
 * once anywhere in the dependency graph makes `.facet`/`.stack` available
 * on every `ChartBuilder` instance.
